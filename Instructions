The language I  have made this algorithm is C# and editor Visual Studio. It is a windows console application.
You ought to put by yourself whatever haystack,needle,threshold you want. To test i put the haystack/needle/threshold given at examples below.

Exercises of the problem:
We have two sequence of data called respectively haystack and needle. We need to search for all the occurrences of any sequence of data having length greater or equal to threshold that appear both in haystack and needle.
For example given:
haystack = “vnk2435kvabco8awkh125kjneytbcd12qjhb4acd123xmnbqwnw4t”
needle = “abcd1234”
threshold = 3
the expected output would be:
sequence of length = 3 found at haystack offset 9, needle offset 0
sequence of length = 5 found at haystack offset 27, needle offset 1
sequence of length = 5 found at haystack offset 38, needle offset 2


This algorithm I have created consider also the one of bad cases: If we have in haystack example"abcabcy". If threshold is =3 it will show the two abc Matched. In the worst case the control of a with d will interupted and the i will be iterated and a will not control with a, but it will go at the b parameter and at these case we will not have another Matched of three parameters, but at these case I have made an i=i-1 so the a will be controlled with a, and the second matched of abc will be.
